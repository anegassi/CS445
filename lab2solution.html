    V8

    Java script engines are responsible for running any javascript code. 
    The engines on the browser are very fast but they need a lot of memory.
    V8 is one of this engines written in C++ therefore it is mutli-threaded program written in C++. 
    It converts the javascript code into optimized machine code in the most efficient way. 
    In the browser as we try to load our website the HTML parser encounters a script tag and 
    will fetch the file from the network or from cache then a byte stream decoder,
    a part of the parser that decodes the bytes it recived and generates tokens according to the data , and 
    then down to a parser where the parser again will generate nodes that will match the tokens in syntax 
    rule specified by javascript. based on this nodes a paraser  generates an abstract syntax tree which is 
    send down to a v8 interpreter. This interpreter generates a byte code to an ignition interpreter . 
    Ignition interpreter uses registers to generate bytecodes ,like the accumulator, input and output registers.
    the interpreter changes the AST to virtualized machine code which will run into various machine optimizations
     and finally passes down to a compiler to turn in to machine specific code.
